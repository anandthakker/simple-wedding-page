      <h2>How We Met</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Jenn and Anand met in graduate school in 2006. At that point, becoming romantically involved
          was nowhere on our emotional radar. But, throughout our year in Cambridge, we caffeinated together
          early and often, watched movies when we should have been studying, pulled compensatory all-nighters,
          became enamored of the same professors, ate eggs at strange hours, debated trivial matters
          passionately, and browsed bookstores (as all annoying grad students do). Anand convinced Jenn
          to abandon previous plans so she could attend “Ugly Sweater Night” at a pub near his apartment.
          Jenn wrote one of Anand’s letters of recommendation for his first teaching job. Anand habitually
          stood in the frigid New England twilight, advising Jenn on seemingly pressing love conundrums.
          Jenn scolded Anand about the love conundrums that he didn’t even know he had.</p>
        <p>In the years after grad school, we kept in touch, proffering late-night advice on dating and
          teaching, and taking weekend trips to Montreal, Washington, D.C., and San Diego. During that
          time, Anand worked at <a href="http://www.parkschool.net" title="Park School of Baltimore">The Park School of Baltimore</a>,
          where students are encouraged to call teachers by their first names and to speak their free
          minds to any passing stranger, while Jenn taught at a boarding school near Boston, providing
          grammatical instruction to well-coiffed young aspirers to the ruling class. Three years ago,
          in a fit of fury over something too boring to elucidate, Jenn left Milton Academy to work at
          Anand’s more progressive school, where we both currently teach. We’ve been roommates since
          June 2011, involved in top-secret “workplace fraternization” since December 2012, and engaged
          since December 2013.</p>
        <p>Although we’ve been arguing with each other for over seven years, we still enjoy bickering over
          the best way to load the dishwasher, the ethics of the organic movement, how much cheese (both
          actual and aesthetic) one can reasonably consume without intervention, and whether certain
          movie characters should be abhorred for their shallowness or tolerated for their realism. Ever
          since we met, we’ve been accused of behaving like “an old married couple,” and we are excited
          to start fully inhabiting that old cliché, in all of its unpredictable vexations and delights.</p>

          Before embarking upon new career paths, putting down new roots, and settling into new routines, we will
          be traveling for four to six months. Anand will be doing some freelance work, Jenn will be
          doing some shameless mooching, and we’ll both be glimpsing things beyond the industrial skyline
          of Baltimore: the insides of foreign supermarkets, the embarrassingly superior public transit
          systems of European cities, the confounded expressions strangers wear when we butcher their
          native language, and – most importantly – how the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=I6p9-DCYdsgC&lpg=PT604&ots=jXb-iARSoK&dq=Those%20same%20stars%20twinkle%20over%20other%20fields%20than%20these.&pg=PT604#v=onepage&q=Those%20same%20stars%20twinkle%20over%20other%20fields%20than%20these.&f=false">same stars twinkle over other fields than
                    these</a>. Although not all trip details have been solidified, possible destinations
          include France, Spain, Kenya, India, Thailand, New Zealand, and Hawaii. In addition to seeing
          the usual sights and visiting every church known to humankind, we also hope to engross ourselves
          in books and music. Please let us know who your favorite artists and authors are, whether they’re
          little-known gems or guilty pleasures.

          It’s become a threadbare platitude to say that your presence at our receptions will be better than any
          present you can give. But, really. We mean it! Feel free to make us a mix tape, divulge your
          famous chili recipe, enfold us in a full-body hug, or tip us off about which restaurants we
          should duck into while in Paris. Truly, we are not covetous of more “stuff” in our lives, especially
          since we’ll be packing all of our worldly possessions into storage for about a year.</p>
        <p>We plan to make our travels somewhat economical by subletting apartments rather than staying
          in hotels and eating in rather than dining out. That being said, we are planning a few indulgences
          along the way. We’re told that it would be crazy to go to Kenya without touring a wildlife
          park, and we can’t imagine leaving the European continent without trekking to Florence to visit
          the statue of David. If you’d like to contribute to our honeymoon adventures, please use
          the button below.

          available opportunity, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcziMI0tol4#t=0m10s">frolicking in the Shire</a>,
          and wandering the streets of Salzburg, where Julie Andrews <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_PJPDMXHOw#t=2m33s">yodeled</a> and

          into the heart of a handsome sea captain. We’d love to feel as though you are part of our travels.
